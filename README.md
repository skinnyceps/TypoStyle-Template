TypoStyle-Template
==================

> Here we are!

After a lot of work here is my first template, full responsive, perfect for a blog with a lot of text. 
This is the first version, I have to fix a few things, but is already usable.
Let me know if you like it.
Support social icon for: Facebook, Twitter and Flickr, and also support Disqus. 
Are you using Google Analytics?
You can simple add you tracking code and just works.

## Need help?

* How to install?
  * Simple, open index.html and copy all content. Go to Tumblr, go to customize and paste your code on EDIT HTML.


In future versions will be implemented the possibility to change text color and background color, but for now enjoy it.
